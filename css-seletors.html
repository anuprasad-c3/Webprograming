<h2><u>Element Selector</u></h2>
<p>The CSS element selector, also known as a type selector or tag name selector, selects HTML elements based on their tag name. It directly targets and applies styles to all instances of a specific HTML element within a document.</p>

<h2><u>Class Selector</u></h2>
<p>A CSS class selector targets HTML elements based on their class attribute. This allows for styling multiple elements with the same styles, promoting reusability and maintainability in web development.</p>

<h2><u>Id Selectors</u></h2>
<p>CSS ID selectors are used to target and style a single, unique HTML element on a webpage. They are based on the id attribute of an HTML element, which must be unique within the entire HTML document.</p>
